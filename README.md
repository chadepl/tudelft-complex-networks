###Things to investigate: ##
- [ ] investigate metrics which we can use 

- [ ] analyze interaction (undirected graph) 

- [ ] read motifs and paper of H Wang

- [ ] think of possible usage of that knowledge

- [ ] check specifics and statistics of the pages for ground truth data (superuser, ask ubuntu, mathexchange)

- [ ] compare network properties for all graphs(metrics like degree distribution) 

- [ ] investigate information spreading processes
